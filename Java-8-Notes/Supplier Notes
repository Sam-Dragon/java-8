# POINTS

1. Supplier accepts void but results Target type 
2. Supplier function
    [abstract] > get - gets the required value of supplier
3. Supplier is majorly used for getting value without accepting any input like "new Object"
4. BiSupplier cannot be created as it doesn't accept anything

# Primitive Specialization 
1. Prevents boxing of primitives & provides better performance
2. Remember that primitive specialization doesnt required any target type to be specified
3. Operation supports
    - BooleanSupplier, IntSupplier, LongSupplier, DoubleSupplier 

# Issues
2. Supplier<void> doesn't work

Note : Always mark the custom functional interface with @FunctionalInterface annotation 
for safety purpose
