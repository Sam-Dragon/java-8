# Threads

- To perform unit of task in faster way

# creation
- It can be created using Thread class, Runnable Interface, Callable Interface - [Not Recommended]
- It must be created with Executor Service framework [Recommended]

# Thread Types
- User Threads: Thread created programmatically & lifecycle is handled by programmer
& terminates when program ends
- Daemon Threads: Thread created programmatically & lifecycle cannot be handled by programmer
& are used for background process & it never ends

# Deadlock
- If resource is accessed by multiple threads & each thread waits for releasing lock of another
results in locking the process

# Deadlock areas
- It can happen due to unnecessary locks
- It can happen due to nested locks

# Deadlock solutions
- code well & test using multithreading
- try using timeouts
- join the threads if required
- It can be programmatically terminated but still recursive in nature

# Debugging
- using commands like jcmd to check PID & kill if required
- use thread dumps for analysis
- try asynchronous way of execution
