> Limitations of future
- combining multiple asynchronous operations into one
- waiting for completion of all tasks or any single fastest task
- programmatically completing the future
- Reacting to the future completion

# Completable Future

> Advantages
- create asynchronous pipeline
- allows multiple tasks to be performed
- waits for all the tasks to get the results
- fetch the fastest tasks to get the initial result
- programmatically complete the futures
