****************************************** JAVA-8 STREAMS *****************************************

> Streams are sequence of elements from a source that supports data processing operations
  - sequence of elements : It will be elements of the specific type like LinkedList, HashSet etc..
  - Source : It will be either collections, arrays or IO resources
  - Data processing operations : Database like operations
    - filter : where conditions
    - map    : select column or all columns
    - reduce : max, min, avg etc..
    - find   : select
    - match  : like
    - sort   : order by clause
> Collections are about data, but streams are about computations
> Streams are classified into Sequential Streams & Parallel Streams
> Streams in java-8 meant to work on Collections unlike in java7 which works on files
> Streams don't add or remove data elements from the actual collection
> Streams once traversed cannot be re-traversed else it will throw exception
> Loop fusion : Merging operations go through in a single pass. i.e. filter, map, distinct
> Stream pipeline supports builder pattern
  - [Stream pipelining] chain of intermediate operations like filter, map etc..
  - Terminal operation like count, forEach

# Characteristics
> Pipelining 
  - Chaining the operations which forms the pipeline. Like filter followed by map followed by collect
  - It provides certain optimizations 
        - Laziness : It means unless the terminal operation is called, streams wont be executed. Basically, it is lazy in nature
        - Short Circuiting : It indicates the operations like anyMatch, allMatch, noneMatch
> Internal Iteration 
  - Processing of data is taken behind the seen. Developer doesn't know how internally it is getting iterated

# Stream Operations
> Intermediate Operations
- Operations are lazily loaded and wont produce the result
- It always returns stream<?> values
    - filter(Predicate p)
    - distinct() - Stateful Unbounded
    - limit(Long number) - Stateful Bounded
    - skip(Long number) - Stateful Bounded
    - map(Function f)
    - flatMap(Stream<Function> f)
    - sorted() - Stateful Unbounded

> Terminal Operations
- Operations are eagerly loaded and will produce the result
- It always returns non-stream values
    - forEach(Consumer c)
    - count()
    - collect(Collector c)
    - allMatch(Predicate p)
    - anyMatch(Predicate p)
    - noneMatch(Predicate p)
    - findAny()
    - findFirst()
    - reduce() - Stateful Bounded

# Advantages
> Declarative - More concise and readable
> Composable - More Flexible
> Parallelize - Better Performance

# Stateful Vs Stateless Operations
> Stateful operations are those operations which depends on the internal state to accumulate result
Ex - Reduce operations needs to know the maximum salary of employee
> Functions - distinct, limit, skip, sorted, reduce

> Stateless operations are those operations which does not depend on the internal state to 
accumulate result
Ex - Reduce operations needs to know the maximum salary of employee
> Functions - filter, map etc..

# Bounded Vs UnBounded Operations
> Bounded operations are those operations which has a boundary
Ex - Get first three maximum salary of employee
> Functions - limit, skip, sorted, reduce

> UnBounded operations are those operations which does not have any boundary
Ex - Unique elements from the infinite number list
> Functions - distinct, sorted etc..

# Creating Finite Streams
- It can be created directly or indirectly as mentioned below

1. Stream.of("Rahul", "Awesome")
2. Arrays.stream(new int[] {1, 2, 3})
4. Collections.stream()
5. Numeric Ranges
- IntStream.range(start, end) OR IntStream.rangeClosed(start, end)
- LongStream.range(start, end) OR LongStream.rangeClosed(start, end)

# Creating InFinite Streams
- Always limit the infinite streams 

1. Stream.generate
- It accepts the supplier
[Java 8 & 11] - Stream.generate(() -> Math.random()).limit(5)

2. Stream.iterate
[Java 8]  - IntStream.iterate(0, i -> i + 1).limit(5).sum()
[Java 11] - IntStream.iterate(0, i -> i < 5, i -> i + 1) ----> Specialized
