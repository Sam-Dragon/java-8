****************************** INTERFACE DEFAULT AND STATIC METHODS ********************************

# Default Methods [Defender Methods]

1. Definition
> Default methods allows library developers to add concrete implementation to the interface
without effecting the actual implementation class & is applicable on objects
Ex - sort() in List interface & stream() in Collection interface

2. default methods in interface must be declared with 'default' keyword on methods and methods 
must have body [package default_method_lamda.pack]

# Resolution Rules [Multiple Inheritance] - Default Methods

1. Extended Class win over interface [package multiple_inheritance.resoultion_rule_1.pack]
- Implemented interfaces can or cannot be under inheritance
- Extended class must extend to any interface with has same default method
- We need to @override the default method and call its default method of interface

2. Sub-Interface win over interface [package multiple_inheritance.resoultion_rule_2.pack]
- Implemented interfaces must be under inheritance
- Extended class will be checked first but not its implemented interface
- Main Class implemented interface will be checked next

3. When two interfaces define same default method [package multiple_inheritance.resoultion_rule_3.pack]
- Interface implemented must not be in inheritance else Rule 2 will be applied
- Main Class must override the default method and call the interface method using
interface_name.super.method_name;

#. Diamond Problem Of Death [package multiple_inheritance.diamond_problem.pack]
- It happens on default methods where a class access multiple interfaces which specifies common
default method
- Solution : Rule 3 is the solution

N.) Advantage
- It supports backward compatibility by maintain old implementation & allows to add new 
implementation to the interface without effecting its related implementation class
- It is also useful in making optional methods if not in usage 
i.e. remove method in Iterator interface


# Static Methods [package default_static_method.pack]

1. Definition
> Static methods allows library developers to add concrete implementation to the interface
without effecting the actual implementation class & is applicable on class
Ex - copyOf() in List Interface & comparing() in Comparator interface

2. static methods in interface must be declared with 'static' keyword on methods and methods 
must have body

N.) Advantage
- It supports backward compatibility by maintain old implementation & allows to add new 
implementation to the interface without effecting its related implementation class
