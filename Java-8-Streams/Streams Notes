# Filtering And Slicing

- Streams are nothing but the data received from the source on which we can perform 
data processing operations
> Streams in java8 meant to work on Collections unlike in java7 which works on files
> Streams don't add or remove elements the data from the actual collection
> Streams operations are similar to database operations
> Streams performs internal iteration
> Streams are classified into Sequencial Streams & Parallel Streams
> Streams once traversed cannot be re-traversed else it will throw exception

# Advantages
> Declarative - More concise and readable
> Composable - More Flexible
> Parallelizable - Better Performance
