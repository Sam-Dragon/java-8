# POINTS

1. Difference b/w Streams vs Collections
- Collections which contains the actual data whereas
Streams can only process the collection data
- Collections can add or remove elements whereas
Streams cannot add or remove elements [Fixed Data Structure]
- Collections can be traverse multiple times using normal operations like forEach whereas
Streams can traverse the collection data only once
- Collections are eagerly loaded or constructed whereas
Streams are lazy loaded or constructed collection
- Collections performs external iterations whereas
Streams performs internal iterations

# Stateful Vs Stateless Operations
> Stateful operations are those operations which depends on the internal state to accumulate result
whereas Stateless operations dont
> Stateful Functions - distinct, limit, skip, sorted, reduce
> Stateless Functions - filter, map etc..

# Bounded Vs UnBounded Operations
> Bounded operations are those operations which has a boundary where as 
UnBounded operations dont
> Bounded Functions - limit, skip, sorted, reduce
> UnBounded Functions - distinct, sorted etc..
